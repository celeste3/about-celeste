<h1>About Captain Jack Sparrow</h1>
<p>Captain Jack Sparrow has been a pirate for too long. He doesn't realize that it's 2020 now, and there's no pirates to fight.
    They are the only pirates left in the ocean. He still walks the plank to see if he can find any skeletons or gold.
    When he was younger, he always pointed the ship in the wrong direction and was forced to walk the plank.
    He has been on at least 1,000 different ships in his lifetime because he gets kicked off on every single one.
    No one knows half the things he says or what he's talking about. He also never regrets anything. He is mysterious.
The only reason the crew keeps him now is because they are the only pirates left and they need him.</p>
