<h1>About Captain Jack Sparrow</h1>
<p>My name is Captain Jack Sparrow. I have been a pirate forever. My crew and I like to throw pies at each other for fun.
When I call myself captain, the real captain makes me walk the plank. I also help the navigator by pointing the way to go,
but they make me walk the plank for "pointing the wrong direction". I also have lots of gold that I will not share.</p>
