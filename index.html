<h1>About Captain Jack Sparrow</h1>
<p>Captain Jack Sparrow has been a pirate for a very long time. He doesn't realize that it's 2020 now, and there's no
    pirates to fight. They are the only pirates left in the ocean. He still walks the plank to see if he can find any
    skeletons or gold, but never finds any. When he was younger, he always pointed the ship in the wrong direction and
    was forced to walk the plank. He has been on at least 1,000 different ships in his lifetime because he gets kicked
    off on every single one.</p>
