</head>
<body>
<p>Peter Pan was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is currently 336 years old.
    He started going to fly school when he was 109 years old, and met this fairy named
Tinker Bell. They have been best friends for over 200 years. He graduated from Fly School
in 1908. Since then, he has been at numerous jobs, like a plumber and a car salesman. In 1999, he decided
he did not want to work anymore, and went to live in the middle of a forest in South America with Tinker Bell.
    No one knows when him and Tinker Bell are going to return.</p>

<p>Peter Pan has been through most of the world. In his 336 years of living, he has visited every
continent except Antarctica. He loves to fly to different places. He has been in every state in the United States,
the Statue of Liberty, the Eifel Tower, The Great Wall of China, Hawaii, Germany, Australia, and many more
places. Many people know him, but some places he has not been to for decades and centuries. He is planning on
discovering more places after his residence in the middle of the forest, which people believe it won't be until 2050.</p>
